                <h3>1. General Cancellation Policy</h3>
            <p>As a general rule, customers are not entitled to cancel their orders once placed. However, customers may choose to cancel their order within two minutes of placing it. The company reserves the right to deny any refund for cancellations, especially if the customer has a history of frequent cancellations.</p>

            <h3>2. Cancellation Fee</h3>
            <p>If an order is canceled after two minutes of being placed, the company reserves the right to charge 100% of the order amount as a cancellation fee. For prepaid orders, the company may retain the order value as the cancellation fee. For postpaid orders, the company may recover the cancellation fee from the customer's subsequent order to compensate the restaurant/merchants and delivery partners.</p>

            <h3>3. Cancellation for Reasons Not Attributable to the Company</h3>
            <p>The company reserves the right to charge a cancellation fee for orders that are canceled due to reasons not attributable to the company, including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Incorrect address provided by the customer or the address falling outside the delivery zone.</li>
                <li>Inability to contact the customer by phone or email at the time of delivery.</li>
                <li>Lack of information, direction, or authorization from the customer at the time of delivery.</li>
                <li>Unavailability of all the items ordered at the time of booking. In such cases, the company will contact the customer and offer the option to cancel the entire order with a refund of up to 100% of the order value.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Cancellations Attributable to the Company</h3>
            <p>In the event of cancellations due to reasons attributable to the company, its partners, or delivery partners, the company will not charge any cancellation fee. This includes situations where the company fails to deliver the order or provides incorrect or incomplete orders.</p>

            <h3>5. Refund Eligibility</h3>
            <p>Customers may be entitled to a refund for prepaid orders, minus any applicable cancellation fees.</p>
            <p>If the packaging of an item or the entire order is tampered with or damaged, and the customer refuses to accept the order at the time of delivery, they may be eligible for a refund of the proportionate value.</p>
            <p>In cases where the delivery partner fails to deliver the order due to reasons attributable to the company, customers may be eligible for a refund of up to 100% of the order value. Refunds will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p>

            <h3>6. Refund Process</h3>
            <p>All refund amounts will be credited to the customer's account according to their chosen payment method. Customers will not be required to pay for orders with tampered or damaged packaging, incorrect orders, or missing items at the time of delivery.</p>

            <h3>7. Refunds for Online Payments</h3>
            <p>For orders paid online or at the time of ordering, customers may be entitled to a refund of 100% of the order value in the following cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tampered or damaged packaging at the time of delivery.</li>
                <li>Delivery of the wrong order.</li>
                <li>Missing items from the order.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Customers must promptly inform the company through the platform, providing photographs and proof of the damaged, incorrect, or incomplete order. The company reserves the right to process the complaint based on the submitted proof.</p>
